Hi，this is Steve Liu. I mainly teach SAT, SSAT, and ACT in Vancouver, Canada. 
Over the years, I have accumulated a lot of work experiences in helping youngsters to become
sucessful in their exam as well as in English classes at school.

<p>Reading classical novels is essential for building strong reading comprehension, 
  critical thinking, and vocabulary skills, all of which are crucial for excelling 
  in standardized tests like the SAT and SSAT. These novels expose readers to complex 
  sentence structures, sophisticated themes, and rich language that enhance analytical
   abilities and broaden literary knowledge. By engaging with classics, students develop 
   the ability to recognize rhetorical devices, infer deeper meanings, and understand historical 
   and cultural contexts—skills that are directly tested in the reading and writing sections of 
   these exams. In the long term, regular exposure to classical literature strengthens verbal reasoning, 
   improves essay writing, and fosters a deeper appreciation for nuanced texts, providing 
   a solid foundation for academic success.</p>

<p>Stamina is crucial for taking the SSAT and SAT because these exams are long and 
  mentally demanding, requiring sustained focus and endurance. Without strong 
  test-taking stamina, students may struggle with fatigue, leading to careless 
  mistakes and difficulty maintaining concentration through the final sections. 
  One of the best ways to build this stamina is through daily practice with past 
  authentic exam papers. Regular exposure to real test conditions helps students 
  adapt to the pacing, question styles, and time constraints, making the actual 
  exam feel more manageable. Over time, this practice not only improves accuracy 
  and speed but also boosts confidence, ensuring peak performance on test day.</p>
